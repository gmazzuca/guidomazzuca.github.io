I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the Department of Mathematics at **Tulane University**, working with [Prof. Ken McLaughlin](https://sse.tulane.edu/kenneth-mclaughlin). My research lies at the intersection of **Integrable Systems** and **Random Matrix Theory**.

Specifically, I investigate how **soliton gases** and **nonlinear lattices** (such as Toda and Volterra) behave over long periods when the initial data are **randomly** sampled. I tackle these problems using the **Riemann-Hilbert** approach and asymptotic analysis.

Recently, I have expanded my research scope to explore **q-orthogonal polynomials** and the **Muttalib-Borodin ensemble**, with a focus on large deviations and q-deformations of classical laws (such as Marchenko-Pastur).

Prior to moving to New Orleans, I earned my PhD from **SISSA** (Trieste, Italy) and held research positions at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** (Stockholm) and the **Mittag-Leffler Institute**.

### **Beyond the Blackboard**

I believe mathematics should be seen, not just written. I created the YouTube channel **[MathyOwl](https://www.youtube.com/@MathyOwl)** to share visualizations and "cool" mathematical concepts with a broader audience.

When I am not proving theorems or coding in Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> , you will likely find me **climbing** 🧗, lifting weights <i class="fas fa-dumbbell"></i>, exploring new coffee shops, or traveling.
