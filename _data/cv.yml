        summary: We study the periodic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system as a perturbation of the periodic Toda lattice equations. Exploiting this idea, we show that the Toda integral of motions are adiabatic invariants for the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system in the thermodynamic limit. This result holds in probability with respect to the Gibbs measure of the system.

        summary: In this paper, we prove a polynomial Central Limit Theorem for several integrable models, and for the β ensembles at high-temperature with polynomial potential. Furthermore, we are able to relate the mean values, the variances and the correlations of the moments of these integrable systems with one of the β ensembles. Moreover, we show that for several integrable models, the local functions' space-correlations decay exponentially fast.

        summary: We consider the discrete defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation in its integrable version, which is called defocusing Ablowitz-Ladik lattice. We consider initial data sample according to the Generalized Gibbs ensemble for this lattice with periodic boundary conditions with period N. In this setting, the Lax matrix of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice is a random CMV-periodic matrix, and it is related to the Killip-Nenciu circular β-ensemble at high-temperature. Furthermore, we obtain the generalized free energy of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice and the density of states of the random Lax matrix by establishing a mapping to the one-dimensional log-gas. For the Gibbs measure related to the Hamiltonian of the Ablowitz-Ladik flow, we obtain the density of states via a particular solution of the double-confluent Heun equation.
