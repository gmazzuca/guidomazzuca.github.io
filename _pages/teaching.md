### **Spring 2026: Complex Analysis**

**Course Code:** MATH 4300
_Tulane University_

This is an introductory course on complex analysis. We begin by introducing complex numbers and their fundamental properties before exploring the theory of functions of a complex variable, specifically studying their analyticity. The core of the course focuses on complex integration, utilizing the Cauchy integral formula. We conclude by introducing the concept of conformal maps and proving the Riemann Mapping Theorem.

### **Spring 2024 & 2025: Calculus II**

**Course Code:** MATH 1220
_Tulane University_

This course focuses on three main problems: Integration (techniques and numerical methods), the solution of basic differential equations, and the approximation of functions via polynomials (Taylor series). We emphasize critical thinking and the application of calculus to science and engineering.

**Key Topics:**

- Integration techniques & Numerical integration
- Differential Equations
- Sequences & Series

### **Fall 2023: Calculus I**

**Course Code:** MATH 1210
_Tulane University_

An introduction to the study of functions, limits, derivatives, and integrals. The course covers the instantaneous rate of change and total accumulation (area under a curve), linking them through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

**Key Topics:**

- Limits and Continuity
- Differentiation (Rules and Applications)
- Introduction to Integration
